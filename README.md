    - Example: Reversing elements in k-sized groups.

2. **Binary Tree:**
    - Implementations of various tree traversal algorithms.
    - Example: Postorder and Preorder traversal using loops.

3. **Graph:**
    - Algorithms related to graph theory.
    - Example: Detecting cycles in a directed graph using DFS.

4. **Linked List:**
    - Operations on singly and doubly linked lists.
    - Example: Reversing nodes in k-groups.

5. **Misc Codes:**
    - Various other algorithms and solutions.
    - Example: Calculating the Nth Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation.

6. **Misc Codes v2:**
    - Additional miscellaneous codes.
    - Example: Adding two strings of numbers.

7. **Questions:**
    - Solutions to specific coding problems from online platforms.
    - Example: Solution to Q.344 of LeetCode.
